> Master **Docker**, Terraform, and **Kubernetes** — Your Gateway to DevOps Success.

#### Git

In DevOps, Git plays a critical role as the core version control system used to manage application code, infrastructure configuration, and automation scripts. It enables seamless collaboration between development and operations teams by tracking every change made to a project, ensuring accountability, and allowing for easy rollback in case of issues. Git also serves as a trigger for CI/CD pipelines

For example, when code is pushed to a Git repository, tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or GitHub Actions can automatically build, test, and deploy the application. This integration makes the entire software delivery process faster, more reliable, and fully traceable.

#### Ansible

**Ansible** is an open-source automation tool used in DevOps to simplify tasks like configuration management, application deployment, and infrastructure provisioning. It uses simple YAML syntax (called Playbooks) to define the desired state of systems and executes tasks over SSH without requiring any agent installation on the target machines. Ansible is popular in DevOps because it is easy to learn, scalable, idempotent (safe to run repeatedly), and helps automate repetitive IT tasks, ensuring consistency across multiple servers and environments.

#### Jenkins

**Jenkins** is a CI/CD tool used in DevOps to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code. **CI (Continuous Integration)** means Jenkins checks and tests code whenever developers make changes. **CD (Continuous Delivery/Deployment)** means Jenkins can automatically push those changes to production or staging servers. This helps teams release software faster and with fewer errors.

#### Docker

**Docker** is a tool that lets you package an application with everything it needs—like code, libraries, and settings—into a single unit called a **container**. This makes it easy to run the app on any system without worrying about setup or compatibility issues. It's widely used in DevOps to build, test, and deploy apps quickly and reliably.

#### Terraform

**Terraform** is an **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** tool used in DevOps to create, change, and manage infrastructure (like servers, networks, and databases) using code. You write simple configuration files describing what you want, and Terraform automatically sets up or updates your cloud resources to match. This makes infrastructure easy to manage, repeatable, and version-controlled.

#### Kubernetes

- [Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD)](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/certified-kubernetes-application-developer-ckad/)

**Kubernetes** is a tool used in DevOps to manage and run applications inside containers across many computers. It helps automatically start, stop, and scale these containerized apps to keep them running smoothly and handle changes in demand.

#### Maven

#### Sonarqube
